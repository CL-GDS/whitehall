  Scenario: Unpublishing a published document
    Given a published document "Published by accident" exists
    When I unpublish the document because it was published in error
    Then there should be an editorial remark recording the fact that the document was unpublished
    And there should be an unpublishing explanation of "This page should never have existed" and a reason of "Published in error"

  Scenario: Unpublishing a published document with design system permission
    Given a published document "Published by accident" exists
    And I have the "Preview design system" permission
    When I unpublish the document because it was published in error
    Then there should be an editorial remark recording the fact that the document was unpublished
    And there should be an unpublishing explanation of "This page should never have existed" and a reason of "Published in error"

  Scenario: Draft resulting from an unpublishing should not be deletable
    Given a published document exists with a slug that does not match the title
    When I unpublish the document because it was published in error
    Then I should not be able to discard the draft resulting from the unpublishing

  Scenario: Unpublishing a document and redirecting
    Given a published document "Published by accident" exists
    When I unpublish the document and ask for a redirect to "https://www.test.gov.uk/example"
    Then the unpublishing should redirect to "https://www.test.gov.uk/example"

  Scenario: Consolidating a document into another GOV.UK page
    Given there is a published document that is a duplicate of another page
    When I unpublish the duplicate, marking it as consolidated into the other page
    Then the unpublishing should redirect to the existing edition

  Scenario: Consolidating a document into another GOV.UK page with design system permission
    Given there is a published document that is a duplicate of another page

    When I unpublish the duplicate, marking it as consolidated into the other page
    Then the unpublishing should redirect to the existing edition

  Scenario: Withdraw a document that is no longer current
    Given a published publication "Shaving kits for all" exists
    When I withdraw the publication with the explanation "Policy change"
    Then there should be an unpublishing explanation of "Policy change" and a reason of "No longer current government policy/activity"
    And the withdrawal date should be today

  Scenario: Withdraw a document that is no longer current with design system permission
    Given a published publication "Shaving kits for all" exists
    And I have the "Preview design system" permission

    Then there should be an unpublishing explanation of "Policy change" and a reason of "No longer current government policy/activity"
    And the withdrawal date should be today

  Scenario: Change the public explanation for a withdrawn document
    Given a published publication "Shaving kits for all" exists
    When I withdraw the publication with the explanation "Policy change"
    When I edit the public explanation for withdrawal to "The policy has changed"
    Then there should be an unpublishing explanation of "The policy has changed" and a reason of "No longer current government policy/activity"

  Scenario: Withdraw a document using a previous withdrawal date & explanation
    Given a published publication "Free ice creams" exists
    And the publication was withdrawn on 01/12/2020 with the explanation "It's too cold for ice cream"
    And it was subsequently unwithdrawn
    When I go to withdraw the publication again
    And I choose to reuse the withdrawal from 01/12/2020
    Then there should be an unpublishing explanation of "It's too cold for ice cream" and a reason of "No longer current government policy/activity"
    And the withdrawal date should be 01/12/2020
